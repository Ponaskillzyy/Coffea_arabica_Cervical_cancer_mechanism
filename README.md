Mechanistic Insights into the Action of Coffea arabica in Cervical Cancer: A Network Inference Approach
Cervical cancer (CC) remains a leading cause of gynecological-related deaths worldwide, with current treatments often limited by issues such as drug resistance and suboptimal efficacy. While Coffea arabica has demonstrated anticancer properties across various models, its full potential, particularly in modulating signaling pathways in CC, remains underexplored. Therefore, we hypothesized that C. arabica might contain bioactive components capable of modulating signaling pathways in CC by targeting key dysregulated genes and leveraged network and genomic data analyses to explore this. First, we identified seven compounds in C. arabica with favorable drug-like properties and pharmacokinetic profiles and their gene targets. Through bulk RNA sequencing analysis, we identified 849 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in primary tumors compared to normal tissues and prioritized 38 DEGs as potential therapeutic targets of the seven bioactive compounds of C. arabica in CC. Interestingly, we found that the 38 gene targets were significantly overrepresented in gene sets associated with the cell cycle, with the p53-mediated regulation of the cell cycle as one of the top overrepresented gene sets. We elucidated CCNA2 as a prognostic biomarker for C. arabica compounds in CC by correlating the genes in the p53-mediated regulation of the cell cycle gene set with the overall survival of CC patients. Lastly, we identified Stigmast-7-enol as a potential inhibitor of CC cell proliferation via the disruption of CCNA2-CDK2 interaction. Overall, the findings of this study offer mechanistic insights into C. arabica action in CC, highlighting the promising therapeutic potential of its bioactive components for CC treatment.
